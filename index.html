        <h1>About Harry</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Ngea Harry Kum</strong> and I'm 22 years old.<br>
        My birthday is on the the 4<sup>th</sup> of November. 
        I am a Cameroonian citizen by birth and i presently live in Cameroon,specifically in the city of Buea.<br>
        I come from a family of six, my mother, father and my 3 siblings, and we all live together in the same house.<br>
        My father is a civil engineer, and my mom is a business woman. Among my three siblings are a boy and two girls, all at the secondary level of education<br>.
        I am a high school graduate from Government Bilingual High School Edea, Cameroon.  
        I'm presently a first-year student at Algonquin College of applied Arts and Tecnology, taking the <abbr>Interactive Media Design</abbr> program.<br>
        I choose this program with the goal of becoming a specialist in web design and also to develop my communication skills,<br>
        but my ultimate goal is to be an Entrepreneur with the media acquired skills.<br>
</p>

        <p> Iâ€™m very passionate about solving economic problems and bringing innovation to better the world at large,<br>
            reason being why I choose Canada as my study destination.
            because Canada has a very diverse culture and me getting to meet people from this various cultural background will help develop my problem-solving skills.<br>
            Christianity is my religion and I'm from a Christian background. <br>
            I love reading, with a focus on books on leadership.My favourite book is SUCCEEDING IN CRISIS by Dr ALAIN NUMFOR,Ph.D<br>
            In this book Dr ALAIN NUMFOR gave excellent strategies in succeeding when confronted with challenges, which i beleive is very helpful especiially in this COVID-19 era.<br>
            My favourite inspirational qoute and watch word is;<br>
            <strong><em>"If Your Condition Doesnt Kill Your Passion And Connfession, Your Confession And  Passion Will Kill Your Condition"</em></strong> by<strong>Dr ALAIN NUMFOR</strong><br>
